##Executive Summary ##

As a (fictional) employee of Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry, I was interested in exploring the relationships between automobile design characteristics and miles per gallon (MPG). Overall, my findings support that choosing a car with an automatic versus a manual transmission does not significantly impact the miles per gallon after adjusting for number of cylinders, displacement, gross horsepower, rear axel ratio, and weight of the car. However, uncertainty remains in our conclusion due to unknown correlates of MPG not available to us in the dataset and therefore, not included in the final adjusted model.
