# Regression Model Course Project

## Executive Summary ##

As a (fictional) employee of Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry, I was interested in exploring the relationships between automobile design characteristics and miles per gallon (MPG). Overall, my findings support that choosing a car with an automatic versus a manual transmission does not significantly impact the miles per gallon after adjusting for number of cylinders, displacement, gross horsepower, rear axel ratio, and weight of the car. However, uncertainty remains in our conclusion due to unknown correlates of MPG not available to us in the dataset and therefore, not included in the final adjusted model. 

The requirements for this course project were to:

  1. Perform exploratory data analyses
  2. Fit multiple regression models and provide justification for model selection
  3. Present residual plots and diagnostics
  4. Accurately interpret regression model coefficients
  5. Quantify uncertainty in overall findings
  
 The brief report was limited to two pages with a maximum of three additional pages devoted to appendices (if applicable). The report was also required to be completed using the Knitr function in R.
